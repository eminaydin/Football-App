## General Info

If you are a soccer fan who likes to keep him/herself updated about the major leagues but also annoyed with the unnecessary amount of input you get in main brand soccer related websites you are in the right place. For the same motivation I have decided to create a minimal website where least needed information will be supplied to users to nor bother them. Enjoy!
